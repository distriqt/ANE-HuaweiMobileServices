# Huawei Mobile Services 

This repository contains a series of shared extensions that includes the Huawei Mobile Services SDK.

The HMS SDK is available as a series of extensions that you add into your applications packaging options.  Each separate extension provides a component(s) from the HMS SDK and are used by different extensions. These client libraries aren't packaged with this extension as they are used by multiple extensions and separating them will avoid conflicts, allowing you to use multiple extensions in the one application.

These are designed to be used in combination with the distriqt native extensions, however can be used as a dependency by any extension.
